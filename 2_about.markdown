The Dabry module is developed in Bastien Schnitzler's [PhD thesis](https://www.theses.fr/s299524),
which is about the trajectory planning problem for light vehicles in varying
and uncertain weather.

The PhD was motivated by the "[Mermoz challenge](https://defimermoz.fr/)" which
consists in crossing the Atlantic with a hydrogen-powered drone.

Bastien Schnitzler is a PhD student at ISAE-SUPAERO and ENAC in Toulouse, France.
